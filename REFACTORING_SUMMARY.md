# Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes all changes made during the refactoring of the CAN_crops mod.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Critical File Naming Issues ✅
**Problem**: Several source files had spaces before the `.cs` extension:
- `JsonAgriProduct .cs`
- `JsonAgriMutation .cs`
- `JsonAgriPlant .cs`
- `JsonAgriProductList .cs`
- `AgriMutation .cs`
- `AgriPlant .cs`
- `AgriProductList .cs`

**Impact**: Would cause compilation failures and confusion in IDEs.

**Fix**: Renamed all files to remove spaces before extensions.

---

### 2. Static Initialization Order Bug ✅
**Problem**: `Genome.cs` had a static dictionary that accessed `cancrops.config` during static initialization:
```csharp
public static Dictionary<string, bool> genes = new Dictionary<string, bool>{ 
    {"gain", cancrops.config.hiddenGain},  // config might be null!
    // ...
};
```

**Impact**: Could cause `NullReferenceException` if Genome class was accessed before config loaded.

**Fix**: Changed to lazy initialization pattern:
```csharp
private static Dictionary<string, bool> _genes;
public static Dictionary<string, bool> genes
{
    get
    {
        if (_genes == null)
        {
            _genes = new Dictionary<string, bool>
            {
                {"gain", cancrops.config?.hiddenGain ?? false},  // Safe null handling
                // ...
            };
        }
        return _genes;
    }
}
```

---

### 3. Parent Genome Selection Bug ✅
**Problem**: In `AgriCombineLogic.cs` line 13, both parent genome iterators pointed to the same parent:
```csharp
var firstGenome = parents.Item1.GetEnumerator();
var secondGenome = parents.Item1.GetEnumerator();  // Should be Item2!
```

**Impact**: Breeding would only use genetics from one parent, defeating the entire crossbreeding system.

**Fix**: Changed line 13 to use `parents.Item2`:
```csharp
var secondGenome = parents.Item2.GetEnumerator();
```

---

### 4. JSON Validation Errors ✅
**Problems**:
- `seed_normalize.json`: Trailing comma in ingredients object
- `selection_sticks.json`: UTF-8 BOM causing parse errors

**Impact**: Could prevent mod from loading or cause crashes.

**Fix**: 
- Removed trailing comma
- Removed BOM from JSON files
- Validated all 84 JSON files in the mod

---

### 5. Incorrect Default Configuration ✅
**Problem**: Strength stat was hidden by default (`hiddenStrength = true`), but user requested it to be visible.

**Impact**: Players couldn't see an important stat that affects food preservation.

**Fix**: Changed default to `false` in three locations:
- `Config.cs` property initialization
- `Config.cs` hidden_genes dictionary
- `Genome.cs` lazy initialization defaults

---

### 6. Namespace Inconsistencies ✅
**Problem**: Template JSON classes were in wrong namespace:
- Files in `templates/` directory but namespace was `cancrops.src.implementations`

**Impact**: Confusing code organization, potential name conflicts.

**Fix**: Changed all template classes to use `cancrops.src.templates` namespace.

---

### 7. Unused Imports ✅
**Problem**: Many files had unnecessary using statements:
```csharp
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Threading.Channels;
using static System.Runtime.InteropServices.JavaScript.JSType;
```

**Impact**: Code clutter, slower compilation.

**Fix**: Removed unused imports from:
- `Gene.cs`
- `Allele.cs`
- `AgriMutation.cs`
- `AgriPlant.cs`
- `AgriProductList.cs`
- `JsonAgriProduct.cs`
- `JsonAgriMutation.cs`
- `JsonAgriProductList.cs`

---

### 8. Incomplete Documentation ✅
**Problem**: 
- README.md only contained "todo"
- No explanation of how the mod works
- No developer documentation
- No inline code comments explaining complex logic

**Impact**: Difficult for users to understand features, impossible for developers to maintain.

**Fix**: Created comprehensive documentation:
- **README.md**: Complete user guide with features, config, commands
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Developer guide explaining systems, data flow, code organization
- **MERGE_STRATEGIES.md**: Detailed explanation of breeding mechanics
- Inline XML documentation in key classes

---

### 9. TODO Comments ✅
**Problem**: Several TODO comments without explanation:
```csharp
//TODO add dict with max values
//TODO
```

**Impact**: Unclear what work is needed.

**Fix**: Replaced with explanatory comments:
```csharp
// Cap at maximum value (should use config max)
// Note: Could be made configurable in future
```

## Testing Performed

### Static Analysis
- ✅ CodeQL security scan: 0 vulnerabilities
- ✅ JSON validation: All 84 files valid
- ✅ No syntax errors detected

### Manual Review
- ✅ All file names corrected
- ✅ Namespace consistency verified
- ✅ Import statements cleaned
- ✅ Documentation completeness checked

### Note on Build Testing
Build testing requires Vintage Story game installation and API DLLs, which are not available in this environment. The mod should be tested in-game after deployment.

---

## Recommendations for Future Work

### High Priority
1. **Test the merge strategy implementation**: The config option exists but actual implementation may need verification against expected "tolower" vs "mean" behavior.

2. **Use config max values**: Several places hardcode `10` as max value. Should use `cancrops.config.max[Stat]` instead.

3. **Add unit tests**: Genetics logic is complex and would benefit from automated testing.

### Medium Priority
4. **Refactor combine logic**: The double foreach loop at lines 23-31 of `AgriCombineLogic.cs` seems redundant with the do-while above it. Clarify intent.

5. **Add more merge strategies**: Consider implementing "tohigher", "random", or "weighted" strategies as mentioned in docs.

6. **Improve error handling**: Add try-catch blocks for JSON loading and game API calls.

### Low Priority
7. **Optimize weed propagation**: Recursive spreading could be expensive; consider breadth-first with depth limit.

8. **Add logging**: More verbose logging for debugging breeding issues.

9. **Consider localization**: Support for multiple languages in UI text.

---

## Merge Strategy Fix Verification

The user mentioned they "Fixed Merge strategies" in commit `02f1dcf`. Reviewing the current state:

**Current Implementation**:
- Config option `seedMergeStrategy` exists with values "tolower" and "mean"
- Config properly initializes with HashSet of valid strategies
- Dictionary initialization uses proper syntax

**Status**: ✅ Config structure is correct and properly initialized

**Note**: The actual breeding logic in `AgriCombineLogic` uses genetic recombination rather than simple merge strategies. This may be intentional (more realistic genetics) or may need additional integration work to respect the config setting.

---

## Security Assessment

**CodeQL Results**: 0 vulnerabilities found

**Manual Security Review**:
- ✅ No SQL injection risks (mod doesn't use databases)
- ✅ No command injection risks (commands properly validated)
- ✅ No deserialization attacks (JSON parsing uses safe libraries)
- ✅ No path traversal issues (file operations use relative paths)
- ✅ No XSS risks (no web interface)

**Conclusion**: No security issues identified.
